  Embracing the fundamental of software laws is the key to have a clear developer mindset

- Here are some of the key points that every developer must master:


 ### 1- Conceiving The Purpose of Software
 - understanding the purpose of the software There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software : To help people.
 
 
### 2-Simplicity
- Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A “bad developer” is just somebody who fails to reduce complexity. A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

### 3- Self-Development
- Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.
